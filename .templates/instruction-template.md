## Template Usage Notes

**When using this template:**

1. **Replace all [bracketed] sections** with actual content
2. **Target length**: 400-600 words (acceptable range: 300-800)
3. **Code examples**: Include 2-5 examples minimum, always with good/avoid pairs
4. **Guidelines**: Keep to 3-7 core guidelines (cognitive limit for LLMs)
5. **Tone**: Use imperative language ("Use", "Avoid", "Always", "Never")
6. **Specificity**: Be concrete - avoid vague advice like "write good code"
7. **Language tags**: Always include language in code blocks (```python, ```javascript, etc.)
8. **Tool-agnostic**: Never reference specific AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

**Before submitting:**
- Run through the quality checklist (`.templates/quality-checklist.md`)
- Test with at least 2 AI coding tools
- Validate 80%+ guideline adherence (see TESTING.md)
