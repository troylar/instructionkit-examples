# InstructionKit Official Examples

Curated instruction examples for common development scenarios across Python, JavaScript, testing, API design, security, documentation, and git workflows.

## Quick Start

### Install InstructionKit

```bash
pip install instructionkit
```

### Download These Examples

```bash
inskit download --from https://github.com/troylar/instructionkit-examples
```

### Browse and Install

```bash
inskit install
```

Use the interactive TUI to browse examples, search by tag (e.g., `/python`, `/react`, `/security`), and install to your project.

## What's Included

This repository contains high-quality instruction examples across multiple categories:

- **Python Development**: Type hints, async patterns, testing with pytest
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Modern ES6+, React components, TypeScript best practices
- **API Design**: RESTful principles, HTTP methods, resource naming
- **Security**: OWASP guidelines, input validation, secure coding patterns
- **Documentation**: Code documentation standards and best practices
- **Git**: Conventional commit message format
- **DevOps**: Docker best practices (bonus)

Each instruction is:
- ✅ Tested with real AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot)
- ✅ Validated for 80%+ guideline adherence
- ✅ 400-600 words with concrete code examples
- ✅ Tool-agnostic (works with any AI coding assistant)

## How to Use

1. **Download** this repository to your InstructionKit library
2. **Browse** examples using the interactive TUI (`inskit install`)
3. **Search** by technology: `/python`, `/react`, `/testing`, `/security`
4. **Install** selected instructions to your project
5. **Code** - your AI assistant now follows these guidelines automatically

See [detailed user guide](docs/user-guide.md) for more information.

## For Teams

Installed instructions are stored in your project's `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/rules/`, etc. directories. Commit these to Git so your entire team benefits from consistent AI coding standards.
